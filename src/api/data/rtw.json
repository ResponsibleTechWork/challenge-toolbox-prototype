A friend doesn't waste your time, track your every move, lock you in a walled garden, or use dark patterns to force you to give up your personal data. I pledge to treat the people who use our products as our friends instead of numbers to optimize, data to exploit, or users that we're trying to get addicted to our product.",

I pledge to design and build better moderation and safety tools that will protect people at risk, regardless of whether they are our paying customers. I will aim to do so before something harmful happens on our platform.",

Most of us will face some degree of temporary or permanent disability in our lives, and minor adjustments can mean a world of difference to many people.",

I pledge to question the working conditions in which our product is made and maintained and pay attention to unintended side effects that affect people at large.",

I will continue to learn about new experiences and perspectives.",

Yet, we often avoid taking personal responsibility for the intended or unintended effects of our work. While it might not be easy to measure my impact, I pledge to aim to be a more responsible tech worker and tech consumer and question product decisions and business as usual, even when that's not officially part of my job.",
